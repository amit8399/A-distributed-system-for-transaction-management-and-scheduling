# Event-Reservation-System-Simulation

Used the pthread API to create a multi-threaded simulation of an event reservation system.
With a small number of concurrent inquiries, the system maintains event reservations.

## To compile and run the code, you can follow these steps:
- Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the file is located.
- Compile the code using the command "make". This command will compile the code using the GCC compiler.
- Run the program using the  command "./q3". This command will run the program and execute the code in the main function.
- In order to give input directly from the sample_input.txt file during execution, run "./q3 < sample_input.txt".
